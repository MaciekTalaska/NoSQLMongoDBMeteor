##  CAP theorem

 ### Consistency
 ### Availability
 ### Partition tolerance

 and you may choose any 2 :)

note:
  consistency = all nodes see same data
  availability = each request gets a response (even if this is error/fail) 
  partition tolerance = system works even if there is partial data loss/message lost, or other malfunction
